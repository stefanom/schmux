## What is schmux?

**Smart Cognitive Hub on tmux**

Orchestrate multiple run targets across tmux sessions with a web dashboard for monitoring and management.

schmux lets you spin up multiple run targets (detected tools like Claude, Codex, Gemini, plus user-defined commands) working on the same task in parallel. Each target runs in its own tmux session on a managed clone of your git repository. A web dashboard lets you spawn sessions, monitor terminal output, and manage workspaces.

## Who is this for?

Have you mastered vibe coding? Did you read and enjoy [Clerky's tweets](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177) about how the author of Claude Code develops? Are you trying to run multiple agents but aren't satisfied with [Gaslight town](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04), [Ralph Wiggum](https://medium.com/@joe.njenga/ralph-wiggum-claude-code-new-way-to-run-autonomously-for-hours-without-drama-095f47fbd467), or other agent automation frameworks?

Then it's time for you to work with schmux!

**schmux is built by schmux.** We know no agent framework is perfect, but we're living through the biggest developer force multiplier since the rollout of the TCP/IP driver. We need lots of approaches.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with schmux in 5 minutes. Works on Mac, Linux, or Windows (WSL only).

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

1. [**tmux**](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - `brew install tmux`, `apt install tmux`, or whatever your package manager.
2. [**git**](https://git-scm.com/) - usually pre-installed or available with your favorite package manager.
   - Note: schmux runs git commands locally in your workspaces, so it will work with whatever authentication you have configured (SSH keys, HTTPS tokens, credential helpers, etc.)
3. **Run target CLIs** - At least one of:
   - [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
   - [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/)
   - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
   - Or any CLI you want to add as a run target

### Installation

```bash
# One-line install (downloads binary + dashboard assets)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergeknystautas/schmux/main/install.sh | bash
```

This installs to `~/.local/bin/schmux`. Make sure it's in your PATH, then run `schmux update` anytime to get the latest version.

To build from source instead, see [Contributing](docs/dev/README.md).

### First-Time Setup

1. **Start schmux** - It will guide you through creating a config file:
   ```bash
   schmux start
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts** to configure:
   - Where to store workspace directories (default: `~/schmux-workspaces`)
   - Git repositories you want to work with
   - Run targets and quick launch presets

3. **Open the dashboard** at `http://localhost:7337`

4. **Spawn your first session** via the web UI

### Common Issues

**Problem**: `tmux is not installed or not accessible`
- **Solution**: Install tmux (`brew install tmux` on macOS)

**Problem**: `config file not found: ~/.schmux/config.json`
- **Solution**: Run `schmux start` - it will offer to create a config for you

**Problem**: `run target command is required for X`
- **Solution**: Make sure each run target has `name`, `type`, and `command`

**Problem**: Dashboard shows "Disconnected"
- **Solution**: Check if daemon is running with `schmux status`

**Problem**: I want local config files in each workspace
- **Solution**: Use workspace overlays - see `docs/workspaces.md` for details

## Features

- **Multi-agent orchestration** - Run Claude, Codex, and friends simultaneously
- **Multi-agent per directory** - Spawn reviewers or subtargets on existing workspaces
- **Workspace management** - Auto git clone/checkout/pull for clean working directories
- **Workspace overlays** - Auto-copy local-only files (`.env`, config) to new workspaces
- **tmux integration** - Each target in its own session, attach anytime
- **Web dashboard** - Watch agents work in real-time
- **Full CLI capabilities** - Spawn and manage sessions and workspaces from your terminal
- **Session multitasking** - See when an agent is done, usually with a summary on what it needs.

## Status

**v1.0.0** - Stable for daily use

See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) for what's new in each release.

### Known Limitations
- Windows support via WSL only (no native Windows support)
- Dashboard runs locally only (no remote access by default)
- See [docs/PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) for non-goals

### Roadmap
- v1.1: Enhanced NudgeNik capabilities
- Future: Browser UI automation tests
