heuristics.
Could you share 3–5 representative captures (raw text is best, screenshots ok if text isn’t available):
- One “good” response with a clear user input area at the bottom
- One where the bottom is ambiguous
- One with code blocks + shell prompts inside
- One with tables or long bullet lists
If raw text is possible, a tmux capture-pane excerpt around the boundary is ideal. Once I see those patterns, I’ll
propose a concrete extraction strategy and updated tests (still no code changes unless you say “implement”).
what's best for you?
• Yes — easiest is to drop raw capture samples into files. Best spot: internal/tmux/testdata/ (e.g., sample1.txt,
sample2.txt, etc.). Then I can read them and propose a robust extractor + tests.
If you prefer a different folder, tell me the path and I’ll use it.
run a bunch of sessions and just send them to the test files
• I’m not running tmux here. Your current code uses:
- tmux capture-pane -e -p -S -<lines> -t <session>
Specifically CaptureLastLines(ctx, sess.TmuxSession, 100), so it captures the last 100 lines including ANSI sequences.
Then it strips ANSI.
If you want to mirror that for sample files, run something like:
tmux capture-pane -e -p -S -100 -t <session> > internal/tmux/testdata/sample1.txt
That will match what the server sees. If you want to include more context for edge cases, bump -100 to -200 or -300.
• Got it. If you save a few tmux capture-pane -e -p -S -100 outputs into internal/tmux/testdata/, I can read them
and propose a better extractLatestResponse plus tests.
• Because the extraction is UI/agent‑specific heuristic (status bars, prompts, layout) used only by the dashboard
endpoint, not a generic tmux utility. If you want it reusable across backends, we can move it into internal/tmux or a
new internal/terminal package.
• It’s in dashboard because the handler is the only current consumer and the logic is tailored to the dashboard’s “ask
nudgenik” UX. If you want it to be a tmux‑level feature, we can move it into internal/tmux and keep the handler thin.
currently accessed by the session details page
• I hear you. The only reason it landed in internal/dashboard is that the HTTP endpoint lives there and there’s no
shared “session content extraction” package yet. If you want it decoupled from the dashboard, I can move the
extraction logic into a new package (e.g. internal/sessiontext or internal/terminal) and have the handler call it.
If you want that change, just say “implement” and I’ll do it (with the “about to change” summary first).
files here
• Understood. Once you drop the files in, tell me the filenames and I’ll take a look. If you want a specific directory,
just point me to it.
tmux capture-pane -e -p -S -100 -t "codex" internal/tmux/testdata/codex1.txt
command capture-pane: too many arguments (need at most 0)
• You need shell redirection. Run:
tmux capture-pane -e -p -S -100 -t "codex" > internal/tmux/testdata/codex1.txt
If you want more lines, change -100 to -200 or -300.
