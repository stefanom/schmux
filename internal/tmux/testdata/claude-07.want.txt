So the plan:
1. Add builtin_commands.json file in the codebase
2. Add /api/builtin-commands endpoint
3. Merge built-in + user commands in WorkspacesList.jsx before passing to SpawnDropdown
That way the quick-run dropdown will show both user-defined and built-in commands.
Proceed?
⏺ Right. Two places:
1. SpawnDropdown (WorkspacesList.jsx:46-48) - quick run menu
2. SpawnPage (SpawnPage.jsx:46-50) - spawn wizard command dropdown
Both filter config.agents for agentic === false.
So the plan:
1. Add builtin_commands.json file in the codebase
2. Add /api/builtin-commands endpoint
3. Merge built-in + user commands in both WorkspacesList.jsx AND SpawnPage.jsx
Proceed?
⏺ Read(internal/dashboard/server.go)
⏺ Creating the builtin commands JSON file:
⏺ Write(internal/dashboard/builtin_commands.json)
Create file internal/dashboard/builtin_commands.json
