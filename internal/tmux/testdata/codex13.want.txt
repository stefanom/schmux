⏺ About to change
Files: 4 modified dashboard source files
- assets/dashboard/src/components/SessionTableRow.jsx
- assets/dashboard/src/contexts/ViewedSessionsContext.jsx
- assets/dashboard/src/routes/SessionDetailPage.jsx
- assets/dashboard/src/styles/global.css
Behavior changes:
1. Replace per-row setInterval based spinners with a single CSS animation (reduces JavaScript overhead when many
sessions are running)
2. Fix React dependency issues in ViewedSessionsContext by reading config dynamically rather than as a dependency
(prevents unnecessary callback recreation)
3. Fix dependency array in SessionDetailPage to prevent effect re-runs
Verification: Changes can be verified by spawning multiple sessions and observing that the working indicators animate
smoothly with minimal CPU/memory overhead.
Proceed?
