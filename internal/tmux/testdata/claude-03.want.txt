- Where in the code is this capture happening?
- What filtering logic is needed?
3. Test with a real nudgenik agent - They mention "we'll see if nudgenik gets confused" and want to "test the full
flow when you have a nudgenik agent running"
4. Context on nudgenik integration - From what I can see:
- There's a NudgeNikModal.jsx component (untracked, new)
- This is likely related to the /api/sessions-latest-response/{id} endpoint mentioned in the exploration
- The endpoint is for "extracting latest agent response"
My Question for You
Do you want me to:
- Read the modified files to understand the current state and what the footer issue is?
- Help plan the filtering approach for the terminal output?
- Something else?
I'm in assessment mode - just let me know what context you'd like me to gather before the agent continues.
⏺ On macOS, you have several options to display a file's hex values:
Built-in Tools
hexdump (comes with macOS):
hexdump -C filename.txt
- -C shows canonical hex+ASCII display (most readable)
- Bytes in hex on the left, ASCII representation on the right
xxd (usually available):
xxd filename.txt
- Similar to hexdump -C
- Part of vim package, typically preinstalled
od (octal dump):
od -A x -t x1z -v filename.txt
- More complex syntax
- -A x = hex offsets
- -t x1z = one-byte hex with ASCII
Third-party Tool (nicer output)
hexyl (needs install via Homebrew):
brew install hexyl
hexyl filename.txt
- Colorized output
- Shows null bytes, whitespace visually
- More modern UI
Quick Check
Test which you have:
which hexdump xxd od hexyl
hexdump -C or xxd are the most commonly used and should already work on your Mac.
