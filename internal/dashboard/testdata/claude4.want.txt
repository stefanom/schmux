2. Workspace Isolation - Each agent gets its own cloned workspace directory, enabling parallel work on the same
codebase
3. Session Management - tmux sessions with fixed window sizes (120x40), pipe-pane logging, PID tracking
4. Real-time Dashboard - React SPA with:
- Live terminal output via WebSocket
- Git diff viewing across agents
- Session controls (spawn, dispose, attach)
Current State
- Version: v0.5 - "Mostly working, occasionally on fire"
- Recent changes: Git status polling improvements, spawn error handling, first-run wizard fixes
- Modified files: SessionDetailPage.jsx, dashboard handlers/server.go
- New component: NudgeNikModal.jsx (untracked)
Technology Stack
- Backend: Go 1.21+, tmux, git, gorilla/websocket
- Frontend: React 18, Vite, xterm.js, react-diff-viewer
I'm ready to assess what other coding agents working in this workspace might need. What interactions or context would
you like me to review?
✻ Crunched for 1m 36s
⏺ Yes. Rebuild and test:
go run ./cmd/build-dashboard
go test ./internal/tmux/...
[GLM-4.7] 📁 schmux-003 | 🌿 main (53%)
don't worry about the footer... that's close enough.  we'll see if nudgenik gets confused.
⏺ Good - it's capturing actual content. The footer status line might confuse nudgenik, but we can tune the
filtering
based on how it performs. Ready to test the full flow when you have a nudgenik agent running.
[GLM-4.7] 📁 schmux-003 | 🌿 main (53%)
⏺ Based on the response you showed me, this coding agent was working on terminal output capture for nudgenik
integration. Here's my assessment of what they need:
What the Agent Has Done
- Modified SessionDetailPage.jsx, handlers.go, server.go
- Created a new NudgeNikModal.jsx component
- Working on capturing actual terminal content from tmux sessions
What the Agent Likely Needs to Move Forward
1. Run the verification commands - They explicitly mentioned:
go run ./cmd/build-dashboard
go test ./internal/tmux/...
2. Clarify the footer filtering issue - The response mentions a "footer status line" that might confuse nudgenik. Need
to understand:
- What exactly is the footer content being captured?
- Where in the code is this capture happening?
- What filtering logic is needed?
3. Test with a real nudgenik agent - They mention "we'll see if nudgenik gets confused" and want to "test the full
flow when you have a nudgenik agent running"
4. Context on nudgenik integration - From what I can see:
- There's a NudgeNikModal.jsx component (untracked, new)
- This is likely related to the /api/sessions-latest-response/{id} endpoint mentioned in the exploration
- The endpoint is for "extracting latest agent response"
My Question for You
Do you want me to:
- Read the modified files to understand the current state and what the footer issue is?
- Help plan the filtering approach for the terminal output?
- Something else?
I'm in assessment mode - just let me know what context you'd like me to gather before the agent continues.
⏺ On macOS, you have several options to display a file's hex values:
Built-in Tools
hexdump (comes with macOS):
hexdump -C filename.txt
- -C shows canonical hex+ASCII display (most readable)
- Bytes in hex on the left, ASCII representation on the right
xxd (usually available):
xxd filename.txt
- Similar to hexdump -C
- Part of vim package, typically preinstalled
od (octal dump):
od -A x -t x1z -v filename.txt
- More complex syntax
- -A x = hex offsets
- -t x1z = one-byte hex with ASCII
Third-party Tool (nicer output)
hexyl (needs install via Homebrew):
brew install hexyl
hexyl filename.txt
- Colorized output
- Shows null bytes, whitespace visually
- More modern UI
Quick Check
Test which you have:
which hexdump xxd od hexyl
hexdump -C or xxd are the most commonly used and should already work on your Mac.
