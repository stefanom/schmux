markdown, to understand this repository.  But you are not trying to act on changes in this repository.\n\nYou
will be shown recent interactions with other coding agents in this workspace and wil be asked to assess what you
think they need to move forward.\n\n
⏺ I'll start by scanning the codebase to understand this repository, particularly focusing on the markdown documentation
to get context about what schmux is and how it works.
⏺ Explore(Explore schmux codebase)
⏺ I now have a comprehensive understanding of the schmux codebase. Here's a summary:
Schmux Overview
Schmux is a multi-agent AI orchestration system that runs multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
simultaneously across isolated tmux sessions, with a web dashboard for real-time monitoring and management.
Key Architecture Points
1. Daemon-based - Go daemon (internal/daemon/daemon.go) runs in background managing:
- Dashboard server on :7337
- Session spawning/disposal via tmux
- Workspace management (git clones/checkouts)
- Log streaming via WebSocket
2. Workspace Isolation - Each agent gets its own cloned workspace directory, enabling parallel work on the same
codebase
3. Session Management - tmux sessions with fixed window sizes (120x40), pipe-pane logging, PID tracking
4. Real-time Dashboard - React SPA with:
- Live terminal output via WebSocket
- Git diff viewing across agents
- Session controls (spawn, dispose, attach)
Current State
- Version: v0.5 - "Mostly working, occasionally on fire"
- Recent changes: Git status polling improvements, spawn error handling, first-run wizard fixes
- Modified files: SessionDetailPage.jsx, dashboard handlers/server.go
- New component: NudgeNikModal.jsx (untracked)
Technology Stack
- Backend: Go 1.21+, tmux, git, gorilla/websocket
- Frontend: React 18, Vite, xterm.js, react-diff-viewer
I'm ready to assess what other coding agents working in this workspace might need. What interactions or context would
you like me to review?
✻ Crunched for 1m 36s
⏺ Yes. Rebuild and test:
go run ./cmd/build-dashboard
go test ./internal/tmux/...
[GLM-4.7] 📁 schmux-003 | 🌿 main (53%)
don't worry about the footer... that's close enough.  we'll see if nudgenik gets confused.
⏺ Good - it's capturing actual content. The footer status line might confuse nudgenik, but we can tune the
filtering
based on how it performs. Ready to test the full flow when you have a nudgenik agent running.
[GLM-4.7] 📁 schmux-003 | 🌿 main (53%)
⏺ Based on the response you showed me, this coding agent was working on terminal output capture for nudgenik
integration. Here's my assessment of what they need:
What the Agent Has Done
- Modified SessionDetailPage.jsx, handlers.go, server.go
- Created a new NudgeNikModal.jsx component
- Working on capturing actual terminal content from tmux sessions
What the Agent Likely Needs to Move Forward
1. Run the verification commands - They explicitly mentioned:
go run ./cmd/build-dashboard
go test ./internal/tmux/...
2. Clarify the footer filtering issue - The response mentions a "footer status line" that might confuse nudgenik. Need
to understand:
- What exactly is the footer content being captured?
- Where in the code is this capture happening?
- What filtering logic is needed?
3. Test with a real nudgenik agent - They mention "we'll see if nudgenik gets confused" and want to "test the full
flow when you have a nudgenik agent running"
4. Context on nudgenik integration - From what I can see:
- There's a NudgeNikModal.jsx component (untracked, new)
- This is likely related to the /api/sessions-latest-response/{id} endpoint mentioned in the exploration
- The endpoint is for "extracting latest agent response"
My Question for You
Do you want me to:
- Read the modified files to understand the current state and what the footer issue is?
- Help plan the filtering approach for the terminal output?
- Something else?
I'm in assessment mode - just let me know what context you'd like me to gather before the agent continues.
