# Git History DAG Spec

## Context

schmux workspaces show git status (branch, ahead/behind, dirty state) but have no visual representation of commit history. When agents work on branches that diverge from main, users need to understand the commit topology — which commits are theirs, where the branch diverged, how far ahead/behind they are relative to origin/main — without switching to a terminal and running `git log`.

**Reference implementation: Sapling ISL (Interactive Smartlog).** ALL design decisions for the git graph visualization follow ISL's approach. No exceptions. No alternatives. When in doubt, do what ISL does.

Primary references (must stay in sync):
- ISL docs: https://sapling-scm.com/docs/addons/isl/
- ISL source: `~/dev/sapling/addons/isl/` (ordering + rendering logic)

UI entry point: the "git" tab on the session/workspace tab bar, alongside terminal and diff tabs.

## Goals

- Render a vertical commit DAG for a workspace showing the local branch vs origin/main.
- Show the fork point where the branch diverged, commits ahead (local), and commits behind (on origin/main).
- Show commit hash (short), message (first line), author, and relative timestamp.
- Show working copy state: "You are here" marker and "View changes" row with dirty file/line counts.
- Follow ISL patterns for layout, sorting, rendering, and interaction.
- Serve the commit graph from a workspace-scoped API endpoint on the daemon.
- Query the workspace's git directory (works with both regular clones and worktrees).

## Non-goals

- Interactive rebase, commit editing, or any write operations on git history.
- Rendering the entire repository history (scope to the divergence region).
- Supporting non-git VCS.
- Showing all repo branches in one view (scope is per-workspace).

## ISL Patterns (Mandatory)

The following ISL patterns MUST be followed. These are non-negotiable:

### 1. Node sorting: ISL topo order + `sortAscCompare` tie-break, then reverse

ISL ordering does **not** follow a pure `(phase, date, hash)` sort. It is **topologically
sorted** with `sortAscCompare` as a tie-breaker, then reversed for rendering.

From ISL `base_dag.ts` + `dag.ts`:
1. **Topo sort** from roots → heads, ensuring parents appear before children.
2. **Tie-breaks** via `sortAscCompare`:
   - **Phase**: draft before public
   - **SeqNumber**: if present (preview/optimistic dag only)
   - **Date**: older before newer
   - **Hash**: descending (stable tie-break)
3. **Reverse** the topo order for rendering (heads → roots) (`dagWalkerForRendering`).

The key invariant: **children never appear below their ancestors** in the final order.
Any ordering that groups all public commits above all draft commits is incorrect and
will create long, misleading edges.

### 2. Dynamic N-column layout

Column assignment is **data-driven from branch info**, not hardcoded to 2 lanes:
- Column 0: main/default branch
- Column 1+: each additional branch gets the next available column
- Nodes exclusively on a non-main branch go to that branch's column
- Shared nodes (fork points, on both branches) stay in column 0

### 3. Column-reservation pattern (main extends to top)

Column 0 (main) always has its lane line extend to the **top of the graph**, even
where no main commit exists at those rows. This provides visual continuity — the main
line runs alongside branch commits, showing the parallel nature of the branches.
ISL reserves column slots even when they have no node at a given row.

When there are **0 commits ahead on main**, the main label appears at the fork point
(below the local draft stack), but the **main lane line still extends to the top**.

### 4. Single foreground color

All graph lines and node strokes use a single muted foreground color (`--color-text-muted`). No per-lane coloring. The **working-copy column** (the column containing "you-are-here") uses a highlight color (`--color-graph-lane-1`) for its lane line and node strokes.

### 5. Circles only for node glyphs

All nodes are rendered as circles. No diamonds for fork points or merge commits. ISL uses uniform circle glyphs.
- Virtual nodes (you-are-here, view-changes): filled circle in highlight color
- Regular commits: open (unfilled) circle, stroke in graph color (or highlight color if on the working-copy column)

### 6. Line semantics

- **Solid lines**: direct parent-child edges between commits
- **Dashed lines**: persistent column/lane lines showing column reservation (background, low opacity)

### 7. Branch labels as badges on commit rows

Branch names appear as inline badges on the commit row where `is_head` is non-empty. No separate legend, no synthetic label rows. The `is_head` field on each node already carries this data.

### 8. Virtual working-copy node

One virtual "You are here" node represents the working directory position, inserted above the local HEAD commit. If there are dirty changes, a "View changes" row appears between "You are here" and the HEAD commit. The "View changes" row is clickable and navigates to `/diff/:workspaceId`.

Edge chain: `you-are-here` → [`view-changes` →] HEAD commit.

### 10. Main-ahead summary row (ISL "Pull" equivalent)

When there are **1+ commits ahead on main**, ISL inserts a **single summary row** above
the local draft stack (not individual commit rows). This row represents the fact that
the workspace can sync/pull to catch up to main.

schmux behavior:
- Label text: **"Sync"** (not "Pull")
- Show the **count** of main-ahead commits (e.g. "Sync · 4")
- Show the **relative timestamp** of the newest main-ahead commit
- The main lane line continues to the top, and the summary row anchors to column 0

### 9. S-curve edges for cross-column connections

When an edge connects nodes in different columns, use a cubic bezier S-curve (not a straight diagonal line). Straight lines are used for same-column edges.

## Design

### Data Model

The API returns a graph structure: a list of nodes (commits) sorted ISL-style (draft before public), branch metadata, and optional dirty state. Edges are derived from parent hashes. The frontend computes column layout from branch membership data.

### API Endpoint

**GET /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/git-graph**

Returns the commit graph for a single workspace, showing the workspace's local branch vs `origin/{defaultBranch}`. The graph is scoped to the divergence region: commits ahead on the local branch, commits ahead on origin/main since the fork point, and the fork point itself with a small amount of shared context.

Query parameters:
- `max_commits` (optional): Max total commits to return (default: 200).
- `context` (optional): Number of shared-ancestor commits to include beyond the fork point (default: 5).

Response:
```json
{
  "repo": "github.com/user/project",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "hash": "f4e5d6c7890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567",
      "short_hash": "f4e5d6c",
      "message": "Add validation for user input",
      "author": "Claude",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-30T14:22:00Z",
      "parents": ["d3e4f5a6890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567"],
      "branches": ["explore/sapling-isl-integration"],
      "is_head": ["explore/sapling-isl-integration"],
      "workspace_ids": ["ws-abc123"]
    }
  ],
  "branches": {
    "main": {
      "head": "b2c3d4e5890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567",
      "is_main": true,
      "workspace_ids": []
    },
    "explore/sapling-isl-integration": {
      "head": "f4e5d6c7890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567",
      "is_main": false,
      "workspace_ids": ["ws-abc123"]
    }
  },
  "dirty_state": {
    "files_changed": 4,
    "lines_added": 207,
    "lines_removed": 331
  }
}
```

**Node ordering**: Nodes are pre-sorted by the backend following ISL's **topological
ordering with tie-breaks**, then reversed for rendering.

1. Build the commit DAG for the divergence region
2. Topologically sort from roots → heads
3. Break ties with `sortAscCompare` (phase → seqNumber → date → hash)
4. Reverse the order for rendering (heads → roots)

The key invariant: children never appear below their ancestors.

The frontend MUST NOT re-sort nodes. It processes them in the order received.

**`dirty_state`** (optional): Present when the workspace has uncommitted changes. Contains file count and line add/remove counts. The frontend uses this to render the "View changes" row.

**`nodes`**: Commit objects. Each node lists its parent hashes, which of the included branches contain it, whether it's the HEAD of any branch, and which schmux workspaces are at that commit.

**`branches`**: Map of branch name to metadata. Always contains exactly two entries: the workspace's local branch and the default branch (typically main). `workspace_ids` links branches back to schmux workspaces.

**`parents`**: Array of parent hashes. Length 1 for normal commits, 2+ for merges, 0 for root commits. This is the edge list — the frontend draws lines from each node to its parents.

**`workspace_ids`** on nodes: Only populated for HEAD commits (where `is_head` is non-empty).

**`branches`** on nodes: Only reflects branches explicitly included (the local branch and main). Derived by walking the graph from each branch HEAD in-process, not by running `git branch --contains` per node.

### Error Handling

- Unknown `workspaceId` (not found in state) → 404.
- Git command failure (corrupted repo, timeout) → 500 with `{"error": "..."}`.
- Empty graph (e.g., branch is main with no divergence) → return valid response with just the HEAD commit(s).

### Backend Implementation

**Files**: `internal/workspace/git_graph.go`, `internal/api/contracts/git_graph.go`, `internal/dashboard/handlers.go`

`GetGitGraph` function:
1. Looks up the workspace by ID from state to get `workspace.Path` and `workspace.Branch`.
2. Detects the default branch name (`main` or `master`) via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`.
3. Resolves `HEAD` (local branch tip) and `origin/{defaultBranch}` (remote main tip).
4. Finds the fork point via `git merge-base HEAD origin/{defaultBranch}`.
5. Runs `git log --format=%H|%h|%s|%an|%aI|%P --topo-order` scoped to the divergence region.
6. Derives branch membership by walking the parsed graph from each branch HEAD.
7. **Sorts nodes ISL-style**: reverse topo order with `sortAscCompare` tie-breaks
   (phase → seqNumber → date → hash). Do **not** group all public commits above all draft
   commits.
8. Populates `dirty_state` from workspace state if `ws.GitFilesChanged > 0`.

Handler registers `GET /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/git-graph`.

### Graph Trimming

The graph is tightly scoped to the divergence region:

1. Find the fork point: `git merge-base HEAD origin/{defaultBranch}`.
2. Include all commits from the local branch HEAD down to the fork point (the "ahead" commits).
3. Include all commits from `origin/{defaultBranch}` HEAD down to the fork point (the "behind" commits).
4. Include the fork point itself.
5. Include up to N additional shared ancestor commits below the fork point for context (default: 5).
6. Apply `max_commits` as a hard cap.

### Frontend Layout (`gitGraphLayout.ts`)

**`computeLayout(response: GitGraphResponse): GitGraphLayout`**

1. Identify branches from `response.branches` — find main (is_main: true) and local branch.
2. Build column map: main→0, each additional branch→next column.
3. Column assignment per node: if a node is on a non-main branch exclusively (not on main), assign it to that branch's column. Otherwise column 0.
4. Insert virtual nodes before the local HEAD commit:
   - `__you-are-here__` node (nodeType: 'you-are-here')
   - `__view-changes__` node if `dirty_state` has files changed (nodeType: 'view-changes')
5. Build edges: virtual node chain + commit→parent edges.
6. Compute lane lines: each column's line spans from its topmost to bottommost node. **Column 0 (main) is forced to extend to the top of the graph** (ISL column-reservation pattern).
7. Track `youAreHereColumn` for highlight coloring.

**Key types**:
```typescript
interface LayoutNode {
  hash: string;
  column: number;
  y: number;
  node: GitGraphNode;
  nodeType: 'commit' | 'you-are-here' | 'view-changes';
  dirtyState?: { filesChanged: number; linesAdded: number; linesRemoved: number };
}

interface LayoutEdge {
  fromHash: string; toHash: string;
  fromColumn: number; toColumn: number;
  fromY: number; toY: number;
}

interface LaneLine {
  column: number;
  fromY: number; toY: number;
}

interface GitGraphLayout {
  nodes: LayoutNode[];
  edges: LayoutEdge[];
  columnCount: number;
  rowHeight: number;
  laneLines: LaneLine[];
  localBranch: string | null;
  youAreHereColumn: number | null;
}
```

### Frontend Rendering (`GitHistoryDAG.tsx`)

SVG layers (back to front):
1. **Column lines** (dashed, low opacity) — ISL column-reservation lines
2. **Edge paths** (solid) — direct parent-child connections
3. **Node circles** — commit glyphs

Row content (right of SVG):
- **you-are-here row**: "You are here" text
- **view-changes row**: clickable button showing "{N} file(s), +{added} −{removed}", navigates to `/diff/:workspaceId`
- **commit row**: short hash (clickable, copies full hash) | branch badges (from is_head) | message | author | relative time

**Colors**:
- `GRAPH_COLOR = var(--color-text-muted)` — all lines, all non-highlighted node strokes
- `HIGHLIGHT_COLOR = var(--color-graph-lane-1)` — working-copy column lane line, node strokes on that column, filled virtual nodes

**No legend.** Branch identity is conveyed by badges on HEAD commits and column position.

### Visual Example (ISL-style)

```
  main            explore/feature-x
  (col 0)         (col 1)

  ○ fff01e5  [main]  "Reduce font sizes..."
  ○ b81131e  "Improve multi-line..."
  ○ 36ea336  "Add multi-line selection..."
  ○ 85ae863  "Detect default branch..."
  ┊               ● You are here
  ┊               ● 3 files, +42 −7
  ┊               ○ f4e5d6c  [explore/feature-x]  "Add validation..."
  ┊               ○ a1b2c3d  "Fix edge case..."
  ○ b2f2d94  "Clean up Docker..."  (fork point, shared)
  ○ 47b7fd1  "Update Go to 1.24..."
```

Note: ISL renders **reverse topo order** (heads → roots) with phase/date/hash as tie‑breaks.
This means public commits ahead of the local branch appear above the draft stack, but
when there are **0 main‑ahead commits**, the public base (fork point) appears **below**
the draft stack. The main column line (┊) still runs alongside the draft commits.

### Route (`GitGraphPage.tsx`)

Route: `/git/:workspaceId`

- Loads workspace from context, renders `WorkspaceHeader` + `SessionTabs` (with `activeGitTab`) + `GitHistoryDAG`.
- Guards against reload: only redirects to `/` if `!loading && !workspace` (prevents redirect during initial data fetch).

### TypeScript Types

Generated via `go run ./cmd/gen-types` from Go structs. Includes `GitGraphDirtyState` and `dirty_state` field on `GitGraphResponse`. See `assets/dashboard/src/lib/types.generated.ts`.

### Data Flow

1. User clicks "git" tab → navigates to `/git/{workspaceId}`.
2. Component mounts, fetches `GET /api/workspaces/{workspaceId}/git-graph`.
3. Frontend calls `computeLayout(response)` to get column assignments, edges, lane lines.
4. Renders SVG graph + commit rows.
5. On WebSocket session update events (which fire on git status change), refetch if visible.

## Current Implementation State

### What's done
- Backend: `GetGitGraph` with fork point detection, divergence region scoping, branch membership walking, ISL-style draft-before-public sort, dirty state population.
- API contract: `GitGraphResponse` with `GitGraphDirtyState`.
- Frontend layout: `computeLayout` with dynamic column assignment, virtual node insertion, lane line computation with column 0 extension.
- Frontend rendering: SVG with dashed column lines, solid edges, circle-only glyphs, single color + highlight.
- Route: `/git/:workspaceId` with reload guard.
- Generated TypeScript types.

### Known issues being debugged
- **Single-column rendering**: Despite correct backend data (draft nodes first with correct branch membership) and correct frontend logic (nodeColumn should return column 1 for branch-only nodes), the graph was rendering all nodes in column 0. This needs investigation — likely the dashboard assets need to be rebuilt (`go run ./cmd/build-dashboard`) and the daemon restarted to pick up the latest frontend code.

## Testing

### Backend Unit Tests (`workspace/git_graph_test.go`)

- `TestGitGraph_SingleBranch` — one branch ahead of main, correct nodes and parent edges.
- `TestGitGraph_BranchBehind` — branch is behind origin/main, shows the "behind" commits.
- `TestGitGraph_AheadAndBehind` — branch is both ahead and behind, shows divergence clearly.
- `TestGitGraph_MergeCommit` — merge commit has two parents in the output.
- `TestGitGraph_ForkPointDetection` — fork point correctly identified.
- `TestGitGraph_Trimming` — commits beyond the context window are excluded.
- `TestGitGraph_MaxCommits` — hard cap applied correctly.
- `TestGitGraph_NoDivergence` — branch is at same commit as main, shows recent history.
- `TestGitGraph_WorkspaceAnnotation` — workspace_ids correctly mapped to branch HEAD.
- `TestGitGraph_UnknownWorkspace` — unknown workspace ID returns error.
- `TestGitGraph_MultipleMergeBases` — branch that merged main multiple times uses correct fork point.

### API Handler Tests (`dashboard/api_contract_test.go`)

- `TestGitGraphEndpoint_UnknownWorkspace` — returns 404.
- `TestGitGraphEndpoint_MethodNotAllowed` — POST returns 405.

### Build Verification

After any code changes:
1. `go run ./cmd/gen-types` — regenerate TypeScript types if Go contracts changed
2. `go run ./cmd/build-dashboard` — rebuild frontend assets
3. `go test ./...` — run all backend tests
4. Restart daemon to pick up new embedded assets
5. Visual verification in browser

### Manual Tests

- Start daemon, spawn a session, make commits, verify the branch commit appears in the DAG.
- Advance origin/main (via another workspace or external push), verify "behind" commits appear.
- Test with a branch that has merge commits from main.
- Verify "You are here" and "View changes" rows appear when workspace has dirty files.
- Verify clicking "View changes" navigates to `/diff/:workspaceId`.
- Verify clicking a commit hash copies the full hash to clipboard.
- Verify branch labels appear as badges on HEAD commits.
- Verify main column line extends to top of graph alongside branch commits.
- Verify reloading `/git/:workspaceId` stays on the page (doesn't redirect to home).
